                I'm a (final year) computer science student with strong interest in data science.
                Currently I'm studying at the University of Bristol in the MSc program <em>"Advanced Computing - Data Mining, High Performance Computing and Machine Learning"</em>
                Asides my studies, I devote some time to open source projects like Tomahawk Player and spend occasionally a weekend building hacks around music.

            Tomahawk decouples the name of the song from the source it was shared from - and fulfills the request using all of your available sources.
            </p>
            <p>
            My major contributions to Tomahawk include the extension of the networking backend to improve connection handling between two player instances and the addition of IPv6 support.
            Furthermore I added the <em>Trending</em> section which gathers the Charts among your peers as well as determines which Playlists and Artists are trending.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently I devote my Tomahawk time to improve the functionality of the resolvers, Tomahawk's plugin system which gives unified acces to music services.
            Recent advances here are the support of a unified API of transforming an music service URL into more useful information like the content of a playlist it represents.

            As Gentoo is the operating system on my laptop, I contribute patches and packages to the Qt, KDE and Science overlay for software that had a recent release or a change in the build system in the upstream source tree.
            </p>
            <p>
            My major work here was adjusting packages for the support of building them with Qt4 and/or Qt5.
            This did not only involve adjusting the packages in Gentoo itself but also meant that upstream sources needed to be patched as many packages were needed in parallel in Qt4 and Qt5 installed but upstream had sometimes not addressed this problem.

            As an addition to the Tomahawk ecosystem, I created some Node.JS packages which build upon technologies which were born out of the player.
            This includes (in the order of the title): a wrapper library to use the content/service resolvers from Tomahawk unmodified in Node, a wrapper to the toma.hk API and a hubot plugin that responds with the metadata to music links it detects in a chat.
