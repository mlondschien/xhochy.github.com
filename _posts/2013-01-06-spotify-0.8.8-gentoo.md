title: spotify-0.8.8.323 added to Gentoo Overlay
---

Some weeks ago Spotify released a preview of their new discovery features and
gave some people the option to test it on Windows or Mac. Last Thursday they
[released their discovery features for the linux version](http://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux/ANNOUNCE-Spotify-0-8-8-for-GNU-Linux/td-p/237426).

As I have not yet found an updated ebuild for the new Spotify version, I made
one on my own. It was not as simple as before as the Spotify package now installs
everything in `/opt/spotify/spotify-client` (which is perfect for re-packaging).
Using the current method of LD\_PRELOADing `libcef.so` works like a charm.

There are several ways to install the package:

1. Use my [overlay](https://github.com/xhochy/gentoo-overlay) as described in
   the [README](https://github.com/xhochy/gentoo-overlay/blob/master/README.md)
   and run `emerge '=media-sound/spotify-0.8.8.323'`

2. Download the [ebuild](https://github.com/xhochy/gentoo-overlay/blob/master/media-sound/spotify/spotify-0.8.8.323.ebuild)
   directly and install it manually.
