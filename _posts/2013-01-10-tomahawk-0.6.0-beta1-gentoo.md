title: tomahawk-0.6.0beta1 added to Gentoo Overlay
---

Yesterday was the release of the [first beta for Tomahawk 0.6.0](http://blog.tomahawk-player.org/post/40092549685/beta-tomahawk-0-6).
Tomahawk is a music player which decouples the name of the song from the source
it is streamed from. Using the [Playdar API](http://www.playdar.org/) it resolves
the location from where to stream using all of your available sources.

If you interested on what is new, just check the [blog post](http://blog.tomahawk-player.org/post/40092549685/beta-tomahawk-0-6).
To enjoy the Tomahawk beta on Gentoo you just need to do these three simple steps:

1. Use my [overlay](https://github.com/xhochy/gentoo-overlay) as described in
   the [README](https://github.com/xhochy/gentoo-overlay/blob/master/README.md)

2. Add `=media-sound/tomahawk-0.6.0-beta1 ~amd64` to your `/etc/portage/package.accept_keyswords` (you may need to change this to your arch)

3. Run `emerge '=media-sound/tomahawk-0.6.0-beta1'`

***Note:*** As [jreen](https://github.com/euroelessar/jreen)-1.1.0 is known to have problems with some rosters,
this ebuild will pull in [jreen](https://github.com/euroelessar/jreen)-1.1.1 which is part of my overlay, too.
